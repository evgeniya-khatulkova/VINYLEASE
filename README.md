This project has its aim to create a generic copy of Airbnb. It's goal was to practise knowledge we gained during the Web development Bootcamp.

To build the project we used Ruby on Rails framework.
It was the first shot to implement search tools on rails, work with hosting on Heroku and upload images with the help of Cloudinary tool.
Also, we put a lot of effort working on the layouts and thinking about the product from theuser's  perspective.

The project was created by a group of 4 aspiring developers in a 4-day term. 
â€‹Thank you checking on our humble work.
